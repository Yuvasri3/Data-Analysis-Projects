# ðŸš—âš¡ EV Adoption Prediction using Linear Regression + correlation (Excel)

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project analyzes *Electric Vehicle (EV) adoption trends* using *Linear Regression in Excel*.  
We model the relationship between *fuel prices, government incentives, charging infrastructure, and **EV sales*.  

The goal is to *predict EV adoption growth* and identify which factors influence EV sales the most.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
The dataset covers the period *2015â€“2025* with the following features:

- Year â†’ Timeline (2015â€“2025)  
- Petrol Price (â‚¹/L)  
- Diesel Price (â‚¹/L)  
- Incentives (Lakhs) â†’ Government subsidies per EV buyer  
- Charging Stations â†’ Number of available EV charging stations  
- EV Sales  â†’ Target variable (dependent variable)

## âš™ Methodology
1. Dataset prepared in Excel.  
2. Regression performed using *Data Analysis ToolPak* in Excel.  
3. EV Sales taken as the *dependent variable (Y)*.  
4. Independent variables (X):  
   - Petrol Price  
   - Diesel Price  
   - Incentives  
   - Charging Stations  

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Results & Insights
- The most significant factor driving EV Adoption is the availability of charging station.
- Incentives, petrol, and Diesel prices show influence but are not statistically significant.
- The model is highly reliable for predicting EV sales.

---

## ðŸ”® Future Scope
- Extend the dataset with *real-world data* (e.g., India EV sales statistics).  
- Implement advanced regression in *Python (scikit-learn)*.  
- Build *dashboards in Power BI/Tableau* to visualize adoption trends.
